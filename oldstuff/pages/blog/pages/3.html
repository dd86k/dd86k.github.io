        <h1 id="title">C# Events? Hell on Earth! - 13/08/2015</h1>
        <p></p>
        <p>"<em>The <span style="font-size: 2em;">fuck</span> is this?</em>" I asked myself, when looking at some examples on C# object events.</p>
        <p>All I wanted to do is be able to do something like <code>Potato.Licked += Potato_Licked;</code> (e.g. Fruit class). Sadly, when I look at <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-CA/library/aa645739(v=vs.71).aspx">this</a>, I always misread the stuff and end up with compilation errors.</p>
        <p>Don't get me wrong, those examples are pretty damn complete, but I wanted something simple to begin with, right? Well here is the simplest I could think of:</p>
<pre>
public event EventHandler Licked;
protected virtual void OnLicked(EventArgs e)
{
    Licked(this, e);
}
</pre>
        <p>Now you and I can do something like <code>Potato.Licked += Potato_Licked;</code> when using our Potato instance!</p>
        <p><code>Licked</code> is a <strong>delegate</strong> because of <code>EventHandler</code>, and a delegate is basically a reference to a method.</p>
        
        <h1>Wait, wait!</h1>
        <p>What if our <strong>handler</strong> (<code>Licked</code>) is <em>null</em>?</p>
        <p>Yes, <code>EventHandler</code> is nullable! Hooray for missing delegates! It can happen.</p>
        <p>So, here's a safer implementation!</p>
<pre>
public event EventHandler Licked;
protected virtual void OnLick(EventArgs e)
{
    if (Licked != null)
    {
        Licked(this, e);
    }
}
</pre>

        <h1>What does it all mean?</h1>
        <pre>public event EventHandler Licked;</pre>
        <p>We're making an <code>EventHandler</code> named <code>Licked</code>, this is our reference for our <strong>event</strong>.</p>
        <pre>protected virtual void OnLick(EventArgs e)</pre>
        <p>This is where the handler calls the event, but not where we want to trigger our event internally! <code>protected</code> makes it only accessible internally, while <code>virtual</code> makes it so they will be used in derived classes. Cool, no?</p>
        <p>And finally, <code>OnLick(EventArgs e)</code>. Our method name with <code>EventArgs</code> as the type of argument.</p>
        
        <h1>Psst, want to lick this?</h1>
        <p>So, you want to trigger the event internally, within the class, right?</p>
<pre>
public LickFruit()
{
    OnLicked(EventArgs.Empty);
}
</pre>
        <p>That's it. Now, you want to use the event externally, out of the class, right?</p>
<pre>
void Main()
{
    Potato.Licked += Potato_Licked;
    Potato.LickFruit();
}

void Potato_Licked(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    Console.WriteLine("CHRIST, SOMEONE LICKED MY POTATO!");
}
</pre>
        <p>That's it. You add a delegate (reference) to <code>Potato_Licked</code> and it will call that reference when the event <code>Licked</code> is triggered.</p>
        <p>Fun part is that <code>sender</code> will send the object which called that event, which in this example, was <code>Potato</code> which you can get by converting it with <code>Fruit Potato = sender as Fruit;</code> or <code>(Fruit)sender</code>. Sadly, <code>e</code> is empty in this case.</p>
        <p>Now, I could tell you how to pass arguments, but the examples online <em>will</em> help you on that. ;)</p>
        
        <h1>So, why would do I use them?</h1>
        <p>When it's <em>getting</em> action. Like <code>Potato.Kicked</code>, but <em>not</em> <code>Potato.Kick();</code>, because it's <em>giving</em> an action.</p>
        <p>Just like in English, I can kick people (dd.Kick();), and I can get kicked (dd.Kicked += dd_Kicked;).</p>
        <p>This is just different on how much power I can pack! (dd.KickPower = -1;).</p>
        
        <p style="border-top: 1px solid gray; padding: 10px 0 0 0;">My apologies if this article is badly written.</p>
        
        <p>Thank <em>you</em> for reading!</p>
