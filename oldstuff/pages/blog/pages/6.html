        <h1 id="title">C#'s override vs. new - 05/03/2016</h1>
        
        <p>Flexibility is an important feature to C#, since there are so many possible ways to write maintainable code by only using the right terms.</p>
        
        <p>In C#, whenever we inherit a class and redefine a virtual method from it's base, the compiler shows a <code>CS0114</code> warning and offers us to either use the <code>override</code> or the <code>new</code> keyword.</p>
        
        <p>Otherwise, without the <code>virtual</code> keyword, the compiler will show a <code>CS0108</code> warning and will suggest you to use <code>new</code>, and you can not override the method.</p>
        
        <p>From MSDN: "The <em>new</em> modifier creates a new member with the same name and causes the original member to become hidden. The <em>override</em> modifier extends the implementation for an inherited member."</p>
        
        <p>So what is all of this mean? Well I hope I had some cool trailer opening music, but let's just jump right in!</p>
        
        <p>So here's an example of our first class as an example:</p>
<pre>
class Base
{
    public Base()
    {
        X = 2;
    }

    int _x;
    public int X
    {
        get { return _x; }
        set
        {
            _x = value;

            Show();
        }
    }

    public virtual void Show()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Base called");
    }
}
</pre>
        <p>Our <code>new</code> example:</p>
<pre>
class NewBase : Base
{
    public new void Show()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("NewBase called");
    }
}
</pre>
        <p>Our <code>override</code> example:</p>
<pre>
class OverrideBase : Base
{
    public override void Show()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("OverrideBase called");
    }
}
</pre>
        <p>And our testing area:</p>
<pre>
class Program
{
    static int Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("   Making Objects");
        Base a = new Base();
        NewBase b = new NewBase();
        OverrideBase c = new OverrideBase();

        Console.WriteLine("   Assigning properties");
        a.X = 2;
        b.X = 2;
        c.X = 2;
        
        Console.WriteLine("   Calling methods");
        a.Show();
        b.Show();
        c.Show();

        Console.ReadLine();
        return 0;
    }
}  
</pre>
        <p>And the output:</p>
<pre>
   Making Objects
Base called
Base called
OverrideBase called
   Assigning properties
Base called
Base called
OverrideBase called
   Calling methods
Base called
NewBase called
OverrideBase called
</pre>
        <p>And now? Explanations!</p>
        
        <h2>New</h2>
        
        <p>As said earlier, <code>new</code> <em>hides</em> the member.</p>
        
        <p>When derived (making a NewBase object in this case), since the Show method was called from the Base class, it called Show from the Base class.</p>
        
        <p>If we call Show in NewBase, it will use Show in NewBase, but since we called Show in Base, it used Show from Base.</p>
        
        <h2>Override</h2>
        
        <p>As mentioned earlier, <code>override</code> <em>extends</em> the method.</p>
        
        <p>When derived (making a OverrideBase object in this case), the Show method will <em>always</em> be called.</p>
        
        <p>That's pretty much it!</p>
        
        <p>I hope my lazy explanations helped you a lot today!</p>
