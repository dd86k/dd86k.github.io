        <h1 id="title">Thread and BackgroundWorker - 11/08/2015</h1>
        
        <h2><em>Lots of calculations!</em></h2>
        
        <p>We all want to do a lot of stuff without a freezing UI or a non-responsive shell. Fortunately, there a few ways to make that happen. So many choices! Which one to use, <strong>Thread</strong> or <strong>BackgroundWorker</strong>?</p>
        
        <p>DotNetPerl explains simply well how to use <a href="http://www.dotnetperls.com/thread">Threads</a> and <a href="http://www.dotnetperls.com/backgroundworker">BackgroundWorkers</a>. The MSDN articles on <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.backgroundworker(v=vs.110).aspx">BackgroundWorkers</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.thread(v=vs.110).aspx">Threads</a> are pretty good too.</p>
        
        <p>Although I'll give my own extra details on <em>which one to use and when</em>.</p>
        
        <h2>Thread</h2>
        
        <p>Thread, sounds simple, right? Here's a simple implementation for a background thread:</p>
        
<pre>
using System;
using System.Threading;

static void Main()
{
    Thread t = new Thread(Test);
    t.IsBackground = true;
    t.Start("Doing stuff!");
    t.Join();
    Console.WriteLine("Done!);
}

static void Test(object T)
{
    Thread.Sleep(1000); // Sleep for a second
    Console.WriteLine("{0}", T);
}
</pre>

        <p>Make thread with Test as delegate, mark it <code>IsBackground</code>, start it, wait for it to finish.</p>

        <p>Super simple to put in but yet <em>very</em> difficult to manage.</p>
        
        <p>They will have to use <code>t.Join()</code> <em>if</em> they wait for their thread to finish their operation.</p>
        
        <p>There are a lot of <em>specific</em> stuff you can do with <code>Thread</code>, like set it's <code>Priority</code> property.</p>
        
        <p>Threads are easier to use in a linear way, like a console application. In UI applications, users want to do other stuff at the same time!</p>
        
        <p>There are just no events that come with the <code>Thread</code> class. Not excluding the fact you can't really know when it's going to be done.</p>
        
        <p>You could use some async magic, but no many people know the concept of... Those.</p>
        
        <p>Guess what -- BackgroundWorker <em>has</em> (safe) events for all of that!</p>
        
        <h2>BackgroundWorker</h2>
        
        <p>How about we start with a simple implementation?</p>
        
<pre>
using System;
using System.ComponentModel;

void Main()
{
    BackgroundWorker bgw = new BackgroundWorker();
    bgw.DoWork += bgw_DoWork;
    bgw.RunWorkerCompleted += bgw_RunWorkerCompleted;
    bgw.RunWorkerAsync("Doing stuff!");
}

void bgw_DoWork(object sender, DoWorkEventArgs e)
{
    string arg = (string)e.Argument; // It's our "Doing stuff!"!
    
    e.Result = 42;

    Thread.Sleep(1000); // Sleep for a second
}

void bgw_RunWorkerCompleted(object sender, DoWorkEventArgs e)
{
    lblResult.Text = "I'm done! Result is " + e.Result; // Change text in label
}
</pre>

        <p>Whoa there, that's a lot, right?</p>
        
        <p>Yes, but it is way simpler to manage. Plus with those events, you can work on other things while it's doing work. BackgroundWorkers are made for WinForms and WPF applications. It's more complete.</p>
        
        <p>You can also specify <code>WorkerReportsProgress</code> and <code>WorkerSupportsCancellation</code> on our <code>bgw</code> object if you want the worker to report progress or support cancellation.</p>
        
        <p>If you enable <code>WorkerReportsProgress</code>, you must add <code>bgw.ProgressChanged += bgw_ProgressChanged</code> after the object creation, and use it to update, say, a progress bar once it gets triggered from a change in the <code>e.ProgressPercentage</code> variable. Confused? Here's simplified:</p>
        
        <pre>e.ProgressPercentage -> bgw_ProgressChanged -> lblExample.Text</pre>
        
        <p>When <code>e.ProgressPercentage</code> changes, it calls <code>bgw_ProgressChanged</code> so you can change any labels, or progress bars safely.</p>
        
        <p>Thing that sucks is that BackgroundWorker != 1 Thread. They will manage their resources, so you can't really touch their threads.</p>
        
        <h2>I think I'll use...!</h2>
        
        <h3>Thread</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Suited for console applications</li>
            <li>Can wait for thread completion easily (linear)</li>
            <li>Specific manipulation</li>
            <li>Manual thread management</li>
            <li>Can use existing methods</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>BackgroundWorker</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Suited for UI applications</li>
            <li>Can report progress and completion easily (non-linear)</li>
            <li>Straightforward to use after implementation</li>
            <li>Automatic thread management</li>
            <li>Can process information apart from code</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p style="border-top: 1px solid gray; padding: 10px 0 0 0;"><strong>tl;dr:</strong> BackgroundWorkers are an easier way to process heavy operations on other (background) threads for UI applications, but you won't be able to manage those threads manually.</p>
