            <h1>DD~!'s Stuff - About this site</h1>
            <p>This website was mainly created to show my stuff with the help of one of my friend! (He's paying for the DDNS name).</p>
            <p>Just a quick reminder, this is <em>not</em> a professional website.</p>
            <p>Did you know that...</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I got mostly inspired of <a href="http://ss64.com/">SS64</a> while making the index page?</li>
                <li>I began to do this website as a school project (Q1 2015)? (Already knew HTML/CSS before)</li>
                <li>I began to learn Javascript while doing my school project? (I was getting bored)</li>
                <li>I was using &lt;marquee&gt; for the news?</li>
                <li>I like doing Did you knows?</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>So.. What's the website for?</h2>
            <p>My stuff of course! What kind of stuff? Well, my projects, my programs, to show the world what I like to do, etc.</p>
            <p>I don't have much to show you, don't I?</p>
            <p>I guess that's about to <pre style="font-size: 2em; margin: 0;">C H A N G E</pre></p>
